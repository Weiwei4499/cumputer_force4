          <h1>FAQs - Buying, Delivery and Refunds</h1>
          <div class="Q1">
            <h2>Buying</h2>
            <h3>What are my payment options?</h3>

            <p>
              Online purchases are made easy and secure with a selection of
              payment options, including credit card (GO MasterCard, Visa,
              MasterCard and American Express), MasterPass, Visa Checkout, Amex
              Express Checkout, PayPal or Gift Card.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I apply for Interest Free?</h3>
            <p>
              If you don't already have an eligible Interest Free card, you can
              apply for a GO MasterCard online. If approved, you can purchase
              Interest Free online or instore today (excludes Apple products and
              Gift Cards).
            </p>
            <h3>Is buying online safe?</h3>
            <p>
              Any personal information you disclose to us is handled with the
              strictest confidence in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In
              addition, we provide after-sales support with a large network of
              Harvey Norman stores nationwide.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="Q2">
            <h2>Delivery</h2>
            <h3>What is the cost of delivery?</h3>
            <p>
              We deliver to your home or office, anywhere within Australia, via
              our store network. Need a more precise time frame for when the
              product will be shipped? Simply check the delivery tab on the
              product page. If you're a Harvey Norman Online member, you can
              track its progress via My Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              The delivery fee is calculated by the size and weight of the
              items, plus the distance to the delivery address from a
              fulfillment location. Multiple items can be fit into one box.
            </p>

            <h3>Do I have to be home to receive my items?</h3>
            <p>
              All deliveries must be signed for when you receive them;
              deliveries cannot be made to PO Boxes. If you are unable to take
              delivery of your items in person - or if you have not received
              them within a reasonable period - please Contact Us.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="Q3">
            <h2>Warranty / Refunds</h2>
            <h3>Manufacturer's Warranty</h3>
            <p>
              Many of our products come with a guarantee or warranty from the
              manufacturer. In addition, they come with guarantees that cannot
              be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to
              a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for
              any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are entitled
              to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of
              acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major
              failure. Full details of your consumer rights may be found at
              www.consumerlaw.gov.au.
            </p>
            <h3>What can I do if I have a problem with my new items?</h3>

            <p>
              If you are unhappy with the condition or performance of your new
              items, please contact your local Harvey Norman store for further
              assistance. You can look up the contact details and opening hours
              of your nearest store.
            </p>

            <h3>What is Computer Force's online refund policy?</h3>
            <p>
              We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase and
              suggest that you inspect your items upon delivery or pick-up, to
              ensure you are happy with their condition and operation. If you're
              not content with the state of your new purchase, please refer to
              our Refund Policy.
